# React Maria
> Maria? &hellip; mARIA? &hellip; &hellip; &hellip; por q√∫e Maria?

This is ARIA components under construction where I'm getting rid of legacy complexity issues in `react-tabbordion` and
avoiding problems like the universal rendering issue that exist in other similar component libraries such as
`react-aria`.

These components will be built on top of the latest and greatest features in React, requiring React 16.4 or later.


## Unique ID management for universal rendering

These utilities allow making components that have no render conflicts between server and client, making it possible to
have unique id attributes in your rendered DOM elements.

- `clearUniqueIds`: call before rendering static markup on server side to ensure client will use same uniqueIds
- `registerUniqueId` and `unregisterUniqueId`: if you want a custom `withUniqueId` implementation
- `withUniqueId`: HOC that gives `uniqueId` prop to a given component

```js
// returns a component which is guaranteed to have uniqueId prop that is truly
// unique on rendered React app (first uniqueId: 'my-component1')
export default withUniqueId(MyComponent, 'my-component')
```

It is recommended that you do **not** use numbers in your manually written id attributes to avoid any possible chance
for a conflict. The generated unique ids end with a number.

### Why Maria implements `withUniqueId`?

React does not provide anything for this issue, see [RFC #32: isomorphic IDs](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/32).
There are other solutions to this problem, but...

**... they have no universal render**:

- [`react-id-decorator`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-id-decorator)
- [`react-sequential-id`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-sequential-id)
- [`react-stable-uniqueid`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-stable-uniqueid)
- [`react-uniqueid`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-uniqueid)
- [`@team-griffin/react-unique-id`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@team-griffin/react-unique-id)

**... or they mutate your component like a mixin (antipattern)**:

- [`react-html-id`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-html-id)

**... or they have no documentation at all**:

- [`@xo-union/react-unique-id`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@xo-union/react-unique-id)

And the remaining solutions that can be found have clearly not spent time to think about the problem or the
implementation is based on outdated React features (like mixins).


## Components

### Overlays: for dialogs, dropdowns, popups, tooltips...
- `Overlay`: for any component that pops on top of regular content, be it list dropdown or full screen modal dialog
- `OverlayProvider`: required for overlays to function, multi-overlay management
- `withOverlay`: HOC that handles `freezeScroll` and `id` props, manages communication to `OverlayProvider`

### Todo thoughts
- `Accordion`
- `Tabs`
